============

A very simple tool organising wallpapers by dimensions.
It takes one input folder and one output folder as parameter.

Inside the output folder, it will create subfolders like "1024x768",
"1920x1080", ... representing the image resolutions

The images in the input folder will be moved into the corresponding folders.
